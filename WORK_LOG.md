| January 7  |           7-7:30pm            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I put in my TST class and added a method to find prefixes since I knew that I would need to use this at some point. I also created and initialized my tst and array of booleans |
| January 9  |           7-8:15 pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I started and outlined my dfs method (which contains most of the solution). I knew that the base cases would be if it is out of bounds, and if it had already been searched, so I coded in those, and I also coded in the recursive step going up,right,down,left |
| January 11 |           9-9:30 am           | I continued my dfs method, and knew that I had to backtrack if the prefix doesn't exist in the tst, so I removed the last char in the String and called dfs with the changed String, but I later realized that this is incorrect so I removed these changes. I ignored that part of the dfs method afterwords, and instead focused on what I needed to figure out what variables to pass into the dfs method. I knew I needed the location on the board as well as the String, and then subsequently understood that I needed the board, the tst, and the array of booleans |
| January 18 | 7:45 - 8:30, 10:20 - 10:30 pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I finished up the dfs method by passing in the arrayList, and figuring out when to add the word to the arrayList. I then moved on to the case where the String doesn't exist in the tst, and I realized I just needed to return. I finished up by adding comments and fixing warnings from IntelliJ (like replacing for loops with enhanced for loops) |
